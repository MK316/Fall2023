#1. The Wise Owl

An old owl lived in a dense forest. Every night, animals sought his advice. One night, a young rabbit asked, "How can I be wise?" The owl replied, "Listen more than you speak." The rabbit learned to observe and listen, becoming the wisest animal in the forest.  

#2. The Honest Fisherman

A fisherman caught a golden fish. The fish promised riches if released. Tempted, but valuing honesty, he set it free. Surprisingly, the grateful fish filled his net with more fish every day. Honesty brought him more than riches ever could.


#3. The Sharing Squirrels

Two squirrels found one acorn. They argued over it until a wise elder said, "Share and grow together." They planted the acorn. Years later, a mighty oak stood there, providing endless acorns for all. Sharing led to abundance.
