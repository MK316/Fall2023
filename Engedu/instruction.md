# Assessment rubrics (example)

Creating rubrics for analyzing a learner's pronunciation is a great way to provide structured and objective feedback.  
Based on the aspects of pronunciation we have discussed, the rubrics can be divided into two main categories:  
Segmental and Suprasegmental. Here's an example of how you can structure it:  

### Pronunciation Analysis Rubrics

#### 1. Segmental Features

These are related to individual sounds (consonants and vowels).

**Consonants:**
- **Accuracy of individual sounds**
- **Consonant rules:**  
   - **Proper Tapping:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently uses correct tapping for relevant consonants.
     - **4 - Good:** Frequently uses correct tapping but with occasional inaccuracies.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows understanding of tapping but inconsistent in application.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Rarely uses proper tapping, often substituting or omitting sounds.
     - **1 - Poor:** Does not demonstrate proper tapping in pronunciation.
   
   - **Aspiration:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently and correctly aspirates consonants where required.
     - **4 - Good:** Generally correct aspiration with minor lapses.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows partial understanding of aspiration rules, but inconsistent.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Rarely applies correct aspiration, noticeable impact on clarity.
     - **1 - Poor:** Does not apply aspiration rules.

   - **Consonant Clusters:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Pronounces consonant clusters accurately and effortlessly.
     - **4 - Good:** Mostly accurate, with occasional blending or omission of sounds in clusters.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Inconsistent in pronouncing clusters, some blending or omissions.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Struggles with clusters, frequent omissions or substitutions.
     - **1 - Poor:** Unable to pronounce clusters, significantly impacts intelligibility.

#### 2. Suprasegmental Features

These relate to features such as stress, rhythm, and intonation.

**a. Syllable Count & Stress Variation:** 
   - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently correct syllable count and stress placement.
   - **4 - Good:** Generally correct, with slight irregularities in stress placement.
   - **3 - Satisfactory:** Understands basic stress patterns, but often inconsistent.
   - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Struggles with stress patterns, affecting word recognition.
   - **1 - Poor:** Incorrect stress placement, significantly impacts understanding.

**b. Intonation and Rhythm:** 
   - **5 - Excellent:** Uses intonation and rhythm naturally, enhancing communication.
   - **4 - Good:** Generally good use of intonation and rhythm with minor inaccuracies.
   - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows some understanding but often sounds monotone or unnatural.
   - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Limited use of intonation/rhythm, impacting fluency and clarity.
   - **1 - Poor:** Incorrect or no use of intonation and rhythm, making speech hard to follow.

Providing feedback based on pronunciation analysis is crucial for effective language learning. The key is to offer learner-customized feedback, focusing on strategies tailored to the specific learner's characteristics or habits, and ensuring that the feedback is easy to understand. Here are some guidelines on how to give such feedback:

### A. Start with Positive Reinforcement

- **Acknowledge Strengths:** Begin by highlighting what the learner is doing well. This positive reinforcement encourages confidence and motivation. For example, "Your consonant clusters are clear and well-pronounced, which greatly aids in understanding."

### B. Specific and Actionable Feedback

- **Targeted Areas for Improvement:** Identify specific areas where the learner needs improvement. Be clear and precise about what needs to change. For example, "I've noticed some difficulty with syllable stress in longer words. Let's work on that."

### C. Offer Practical Strategies

- **Tailored Techniques:** Suggest strategies or exercises that align with the learner's unique needs. For instance, if they struggle with intonation, you might recommend sing-song exercises or mimicry practice.
- **Incremental Steps:** Break down the advice into manageable tasks. For example, "Start by practicing stress patterns in simple words, then gradually move to sentences."

### D. Demonstrate Correct Pronunciation

- **Modeling:** Provide clear examples of correct pronunciation. This could be through your own speech or using audio resources.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Sometimes, playing their recording alongside a standard pronunciation can help learners notice differences.

### E. Encourage Self-Monitoring

- **Reflective Practice:** Encourage learners to record and listen to their speech, fostering self-awareness and independent learning.
- **Use of Tools:** Recommend apps or tools that provide feedback on pronunciation, offering additional support outside of lessons.

### F. Use Visual Aids

- **Illustrative Materials:** Use diagrams or visual cues to explain concepts like mouth positioning or breath control, which can be especially helpful for visual learners.

Remember, the goal of feedback is not only to inform the learner of their pronunciation issues but also to guide and motivate them towards improvement. Balancing constructive criticism with encouragement is key to effective language teaching.

### 4. Notes
- Each category and sub-category should be rated based on the learner's recorded speech.
- The scores can then be added up to give a comprehensive view of their pronunciation skills, with specific areas highlighted for improvement. 
- This structured approach makes it easier for learners to understand their strengths and weaknesses in pronunciation.
