# Assessment rubrics (example)

Creating rubrics for analyzing a learner's pronunciation is a great way to provide structured and objective feedback.  
Based on the aspects of pronunciation we have discussed, the rubrics can be divided into two main categories:  
Segmental and Suprasegmental. Here's an example of how you can structure it:  

### Pronunciation Analysis Rubrics

#### 1. Segmental Features

These are related to individual sounds (consonants and vowels).

**Consonants:**
- **Accuracy of individual sounds** 
   - **Proper Tapping:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently uses correct tapping for relevant consonants.
     - **4 - Good:** Frequently uses correct tapping but with occasional inaccuracies.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows understanding of tapping but inconsistent in application.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Rarely uses proper tapping, often substituting or omitting sounds.
     - **1 - Poor:** Does not demonstrate proper tapping in pronunciation.
   
   - **Aspiration:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently and correctly aspirates consonants where required.
     - **4 - Good:** Generally correct aspiration with minor lapses.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows partial understanding of aspiration rules, but inconsistent.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Rarely applies correct aspiration, noticeable impact on clarity.
     - **1 - Poor:** Does not apply aspiration rules.

   - **Consonant Clusters:** 
     - **5 - Excellent:** Pronounces consonant clusters accurately and effortlessly.
     - **4 - Good:** Mostly accurate, with occasional blending or omission of sounds in clusters.
     - **3 - Satisfactory:** Inconsistent in pronouncing clusters, some blending or omissions.
     - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Struggles with clusters, frequent omissions or substitutions.
     - **1 - Poor:** Unable to pronounce clusters, significantly impacts intelligibility.

#### 2. Suprasegmental Features

These relate to features such as stress, rhythm, and intonation.

**a. Syllable Count & Stress Variation:** 
   - **5 - Excellent:** Consistently correct syllable count and stress placement.
   - **4 - Good:** Generally correct, with slight irregularities in stress placement.
   - **3 - Satisfactory:** Understands basic stress patterns, but often inconsistent.
   - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Struggles with stress patterns, affecting word recognition.
   - **1 - Poor:** Incorrect stress placement, significantly impacts understanding.

**b. Intonation and Rhythm:** 
   - **5 - Excellent:** Uses intonation and rhythm naturally, enhancing communication.
   - **4 - Good:** Generally good use of intonation and rhythm with minor inaccuracies.
   - **3 - Satisfactory:** Shows some understanding but often sounds monotone or unnatural.
   - **2 - Needs Improvement:** Limited use of intonation/rhythm, impacting fluency and clarity.
   - **1 - Poor:** Incorrect or no use of intonation and rhythm, making speech hard to follow.

Each category and sub-category should be rated based on the learner's recorded speech. The scores can then be added up to give a comprehensive view of their pronunciation skills, with specific areas highlighted for improvement. This structured approach makes it easier for learners to understand their strengths and weaknesses in pronunciation.
