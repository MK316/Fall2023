A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another. For example, in English, the sounds represented by the letters "p" and "b" are distinct phonemes, as they can change the meaning of a word (for example, "pat" versus "bat"). Phonemes are abstract and are not the letters themselves, but the sounds those letters represent. They are the building blocks of spoken language and are crucial for phonetics and linguistics.
